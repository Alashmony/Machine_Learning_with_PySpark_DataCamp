    "## Machine Learning & Spark\n",
    "1. Machine Learning & Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi! Welcome to the course on Machine Learning with Apache Spark, in which you will learn how to build Machine Learning models on large data sets using distributed computing techniques. Let's start with some fundamental concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Building the perfect waffle (an analogy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you wanted to teach a computer how to make waffles. You could find a good recipe and then give the computer explicit instructions about ingredients and proportions. Alternatively, you could present the computer with a selection of different waffle recipes and let it figure out the ingredients and proportions for the best recipe. The second approach is how Machine Learning works: the computer literally learns from examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Regression & classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning problems are generally less esoteric than finding the perfect waffle recipe. The most common problems apply either Regression or Classification. A regression model learns to predict a number. For example, when making waffles, how much flour should be used for a particular amount of sugar? A classification model, on the other hand, predicts a discrete or categorical value. For example, is a recipe calling for a particular amount of sugar and salt more likely to be for waffles or cupcakes?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data in RAM\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of a Machine Learning model depends on data. In general, more data is a good thing. If an algorithm is able to train on a larger set of data, then its ability to generalize to new data will inevitably improve. However, there are some practical constraints. If the data can fit entirely into RAM then the algorithm can operate efficiently. What happens when those data no longer fit into memory?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data exceeds RAM\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer will start to use *virtual memory* and data will be *paged* back and forth between RAM and disk. Relative to RAM access, retrieving data from disk is slow. As the size of the data grows, paging becomes more intense and the computer begins to spend more and more time waiting for data. Performance plummets.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Data distributed across a cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "How then do we deal with truly large datasets? One option is to distribute the problem across multiple computers in a cluster. Rather than trying to handle a large dataset on a single machine, it's divided up into partitions which are processed separately. Ideally each data partition can fit into RAM on a single computer in the cluster. This is the approach used by Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is Spark?\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark is a general purpose framework for cluster computing. It is popular for two main reasons: 1. it's generally much faster than other Big Data technologies like Hadoop, because it does most processing in memory and 2. it has a developer-friendly interface which hides much of the complexity of distributed computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Components: nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review the components of a Spark cluster. The cluster itself consists of one or more nodes. Each node is a computer with CPU, RAM and physical storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Components: cluster manager\n",
    "\n",
    "A cluster manager allocates resources and coordinates activity across the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Components: driver\n",
    "\n",
    "Every application running on the Spark cluster has a driver program. Using the Spark API, the driver communicates with the cluster manager, which in turn distributes work to the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Components: executors\n",
    "\n",
    "On each node Spark launches an executor process which persists for the duration of the application. Work is divided up into tasks, which are simply units of computation. The executors run tasks in multiple threads across the cores in a node. When working with Spark you normally don't need to worry *too* much about the details of the cluster. Spark sets up all of that infrastructure for you and handles all interactions within the cluster. However, it's still useful to know how it works under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Onward!\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have a basic understanding of the principles of Machine Learning and distributed computing with Spark. Next we'll learn how to connect to a Spark cluster."

    "## Connecting to Spark\n",
    "1. Connecting to Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous lesson was high level overviews of Machine Learning and Spark. In this lesson you'll review the process of connecting to Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Interacting with Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "The connection with Spark is established by the driver, which can be written in either Java, Scala, Python or R. Each of these languages has advantages and disadvantages. Java is relatively verbose, requiring a lot of code to accomplish even simple tasks. By contrast, Scala, Python and R, are high-level languages which can accomplish much with only a small amount of code. They also offer a REPL, or Read-Evaluate-Print loop, which is crucial for interactive development. You'll be using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Importing pyspark\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn't talk natively to Spark, so we'll kick off by importing the pyspark module, which makes Spark functionality available in the Python interpreter. Spark is under vigorous development. Because the interface is evolving it's important to know what version you're working with. We'll be using version 2.4.1, which was released in March 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sub-modules\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the main pyspark module, there are a few sub-modules which implement different aspects of the Spark interface. There are two versions of Spark Machine Learning: mllib, which uses an unstructured representation of data in RDDs and has been deprecated, and ml which is based on a structured, tabular representation of data in DataFrames. We'll be using the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Spark URL\n",
    "\n",
    "With the pyspark module loaded, you are able to connect to Spark. The next thing you need to do is tell Spark where the cluster is located. Here there are two options. You can either connect to a remote cluster, in which case you need to specify a Spark URL, which gives the network location of the cluster's master node. The URL is composed of an IP address or DNS name and a port number. The default port for Spark is 7077, but this must still be explicitly specified. When you're figuring out how Spark works, the infrastructure of a distributed cluster can get in the way. That's why it's useful to create a local cluster, where everything happens on a single computer. This is the setup that you're going to use throughout this course. For a local cluster, you need only specify \"local\" and, optionally, the number of cores to use. By default, a local cluster will run on a single core. Alternatively, you can give a specific number of cores or simply use the wildcard to choose all available cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Creating a SparkSession\n",
    "\n",
    "You connect to Spark by creating a SparkSession object. The SparkSession class is found in the pyspark.sql sub-module. You specify the location of the cluster using the master() method. Optionally you can assign a name to the application using the appName() method. Finally you call the getOrCreate() method, which will either create a new session object or return an existing object. Once the session has been created you are able to interact with Spark. Finally, although it's possible for multiple SparkSessions to co-exist, it's good practice to stop the SparkSession when you're done.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lesson you'll look at how to read data into Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DataFrames: A refresher\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark represents tabular data using the DataFrame class. The data are captured as rows (or \"records\"), each of which is broken down into one or more columns (or \"fields\"). Every column has a name and a specific data type. Some selected methods and attributes of the DataFrame class are listed here. The count() method gives the number of rows. The show() method will display a subset of rows. The printSchema() method and the dtypes attribute give different views on column types. This is really scratching the surface of what's possible with a DataFrame. You can find out more by consulting the extensive documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. CSV data for cars\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV is a common format for storing tabular data. For illustration we'll be using a CSV file with characteristics for a selection of motor vehicles. Each line in a CSV file is a new record and within each record, fields are separated by a delimiter character, which is normally a comma. The first line is an optional header record which gives column names.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Reading data from CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "Our session object has a \"read\" attribute which, in turn, has a csv() method which reads data from a CSV file and returns a DataFrame. The csv() method has one mandatory argument, the path to the CSV file. There are a number of optional arguments. We'll take a quick look at some of the most important ones. The header argument specifies whether or not there is a header record. The sep argument gives the field separator, which is a comma by default. There are two arguments which pertain to column data types, schema and inferSchema. Finally, the nullValue argument gives the placeholder used to indicate missing data. Let's take a look at the data we've just loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Peek at the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the show() method we can take a look at a slice of the DataFrame. The csv() method has split the data into rows and columns and picked up the column names from the header record. Looks great, doesn't it? Unfortunately there's a small snag. Before we unravel that snag, it's important to note that the first value in the cylinder column is not a number. It's the string \"NA\" which indicates missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Check column types\n",
    "\n",
    "If you check the column data types then you'll find that they are all strings. That doesn't make sense since the last six columns are clearly numbers! However, this is the expected behavior: the csv() method treats all columns as strings by default. You need to do a little more work to get the correct column types. There are two ways that you can do this: infer the column types from the data or manually specify the types.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Inferring column types from data\n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible to reasonably deduce the column types by setting the inferSchema argument to True. There is a price to pay though: Spark needs to make an extra pass over the data to figure out the column types before reading the data. If the data file is big then this will increase load time notably. Using this approach all of the column types are correctly identified except for cylinder. Why? The first value in this column is \"NA\", so Spark thinks that the column contains strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Dealing with missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing data in CSV files are normally represented by a placeholder like the \"NA\" string. You can use the nullValue argument to specify the placeholder. It's always a good idea to explicitly define the missing data placeholder. The nullValue argument is case sensitive, so it's important to provide it in exactly the same form as it appears in the data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Specify column types\n",
    "\n",
    "If inferring column type is not successful then you have the option of specifying the type of each column in an explicit schema. This also makes it possible to choose alternative column names.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Final cars data\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what the final cars data look like. Note that the missing value at the top of the cylinders column is indicated by the special null constant.\n",

    "## Data Preparation\n",
    "1. Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson you are going to learn how to prepare data for building a Machine Learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Do you need all of those columns?\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be working with the cars data again. This is what the data look like at present. There are columns for the maker and model, the origin (either USA or non-USA), the type, number of cylinders, engine size, weight, length, RPM and fuel consumption. The models that you'll be building will depend on the physical characteristics of the cars rather than the model names or manufacturers, so you'll remove the corresponding columns from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dropping columns\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two approaches to doing this: either you can drop() the columns that you don't want or you can select() the fields which you do want to retain. Either way, the resulting data does not include those columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Filtering out missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier you saw that there is a missing value in the cylinders column. Let's check to see how many other missing values there are. You'll use the filter() method and provide a logical predicate using SQL syntax which identifies NULL values. Then the count() method tells you how many records there are remaining. Just one. In this case it makes sense to simply remove the record with the missing value. There are a couple of ways that you could to do this. You could use the filter() method again with a different predicate. Or you could take a more aggressive approach and use the dropna() method to drop all records with missing values in any column. However, this should be done with care because it could result in the loss of a lot of otherwise useful data. You've now stripped down the data to what's needed to build a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Mutating columns\n",
    "\n",
    "At present the weight and length columns are in units of pounds and inches respectively. You'll use the withColumn() method to create a new mass column in units of kilograms. The round() function is used to limit the precision of the result. You can also use the withColumn() method to replace the existing length column with values in meters. You now have mass and length in metric units.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Indexing categorical data\n",
    "\n",
    "The type column consists of strings which represent six categories of vehicle type. You'll need to transform those strings into numbers. You do this using an instance of the StringIndexer class. In the constructor you provide the name of the string input column and a name for the new output column to be created. The indexer is first fit to the data, creating a StringIndexerModel. During the fitting process the distinct string values are identified and an index is assigned to each value. The model is then used to transform the data, creating a new column with the index values. By default the index values are assigned according to the descending relative frequency of each of the string values. Midsize is most common, so it gets an index of zero. Small is next most common, so its index is one. And so on. It's possible to choose different strategies for assigning index values by specifying the stringOrderType argument. Rather than using frequency of occurrence, strings can be ordered alphabetically. It's also possible to choose between ascending and descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Indexing country of origin\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be building a classifier to predict whether or not a car was manufactured in the USA. So the origin column also needs to be converted from strings into numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Assembling columns\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step in preparing the cars data is to consolidate the various input columns into a single column. This is necessary because the Machine Learning algorithms in Spark operate on a single vector of predictors, although each element in that vector may consist of multiple values. To illustrate the process you'll start with just a pair of features, cylinders and size. First you create an instance of the VectorAssembler class, providing it with the names of the columns that you want to consolidate and the name of the new output column. The assembler is then used to transform the data. Taking a look at the relevant columns you see that the new \"features\" column consists of values from the cylinders and size columns consolidated into a vector. Ultimately you are going to assemble all of the predictors into a single column.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Let's practice!\n",

    "1. Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first Machine Learning model will be a Decision Tree. This is probably the most intuitive model, so it seems like a good place to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Anatomy of a Decision Tree: Root node\n",
    "\n",
    "A Decision Tree is constructed using an algorithm called \"Recursive Partitioning\". Consider a hypothetical example in which you build a Decision Tree to divide data into two classes, green and blue. You start by putting all of the records into the root node. Suppose that there are more green records than blue, in which case this node will be labelled \"green\". Now from amongst the predictors in the data you need to choose the one that will result in the most informative split of the data into two groups. Ideally you want the groups to be as homogeneous (or \"pure\") as possible: one should be mostly green and the other should be mostly blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Anatomy of a Decision Tree: First split\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have identified the most informative predictor, you split the data into two sets, labeled \"green\" or \"blue\" according to the dominant class. And this is where the recursion kicks in: you then apply exactly the same procedure on each of the child nodes, selecting the most informative predictor and splitting again.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Anatomy of a Decision Tree: Second split\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, the green node on the left could be split again into two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Anatomy of a Decision Tree: Third split\n",
    "\n",
    "And the resulting green node could once again be split. The depth of each branch of the tree need not be the same. There are a variety of stopping criteria which can cause splitting to stop along a branch. For example, if the number of records in a node falls below a threshold or the purity of a node is above a threshold, then you might stop splitting. Once you have built the Decision Tree you can use it to make predictions for new data by following the splits from the root node along to the tip of a branch. The label for the final node would then be the prediction for the new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Classifying cars\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make this more concrete by looking at the cars data. You've transformed the country of origin column into a numeric index called 'label', with zero corresponding to cars manufactured in the USA and one for everything else. The remaining columns have all been consolidated into a column called 'features'. You want to build a Decision Tree which will use \"features\" to predict \"label\".\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Split train/test\n",
    "\n",
    "An important aspect of building a Machine Learning model is being able to assess how well it works. In order to do this we use the randomSplit() method to randomly split our data into two sets, a training set and a testing set. The proportions may vary, but generally you're looking at something like an 80:20 split, which means that the training set ends up having around 4 times as many records as the testing set.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Build a Decision Tree model\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the moment has come, you're going to build a Decision Tree. You start by creating a DecisionTreeClassifier() object. The next step is to fit the model to the training data by calling the fit() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Evaluating\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've trained the model you can assess how effective it is by making predictions on the test set and comparing the predictions to the known values. The transform() method adds new columns to the DataFrame. The prediction column gives the class assigned by the model. You can compare this directly to the known labels in the testing data. Although the model gets the first example wrong, it's correct for the following four examples. There's also a probability column which gives the probabilities assigned to each of the outcome classes. For the first example, the model predicts that the outcome is 0 with probability 96%.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Confusion matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to understand the performance of a model is to create a confusion matrix which gives a breakdown of the model predictions versus the known labels. The confusion matrix consists of four counts which are labelled as follows: - \"positive\" indicates a prediction of 1, while - \"negative\" indicates a prediction of 0 and - \"true\" corresponds to a correct prediction, while - \"false\" designates an incorrect prediction. In this case the true positives and true negatives dominate but the model still makes a number of incorrect predictions. These counts can be used to calculate the accuracy, which is the proportion of correct predictions. For our model the accuracy is 74%.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Let's build Decision Trees!\n",

    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "You've learned to build a Decision Tree. But it's good to have options. Logistic Regression is another commonly used classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Logistic Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses a logistic function to model a binary target, where the target states are usually denoted by 1 and 0 or TRUE and FALSE. The maths of the model are outside the scope of this course, but this is what the logistic function looks like. For a Logistic Regression model the x-axis is a linear combination of predictor variables and the y-axis is the output of the model. Since the value of the logistic function is a number between zero and one, it's often thought of as a probability. In order to translate this number into one or other of the target states it's compared to a threshold, which is normally set at one half.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Logistic Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number is above the threshold then the predicted state is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Logistic Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, if it's below the threshold then the predicted state is zero. The model derives coefficients for each of the numerical predictors. Those coefficients might...\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Logistic Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "shift the curve to the right...\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Logistic Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "or to the left. They might make the transition between states...\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Logistic Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "more gradual...\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Logistic Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "or more rapid. These characteristics are all extracted from the training data and will vary from one set of data to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Cars revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make this more concrete by returning to the cars data. You'll focus on the numerical predictors for the moment and return to categorical predictors later on. As before you prepare the data by consolidating the predictors into a single column and then randomly splitting the data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Build a Logistic Regression model\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a Logistic Regression model you first need to import the associated class and then create a classifier object. This is then fit to the training data using the fit() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "With a trained model you are able to make predictions on the testing data. As you saw with the Decision Tree, the transform() method adds the prediction and probability columns. The probability column gives the predicted probability of each class, while the prediction column reflects the predicted label, which is derived from the probabilities by applying the threshold mentioned earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Precision and recall\n",
    "\n",
    "You can assess the quality of the predictions by forming a confusion matrix. The quantities in the cells of the matrix can then be used to form some informative ratios. Recall that a positive prediction indicates that a car is manufactured outside of the USA and that predictions are considered to be true or false depending on whether they are correct or not. Precision is the proportion of positive predictions which are correct. For your model, two thirds of predictions for cars manufactured outside of the USA are correct. Recall is the proportion of positive targets which are correctly predicted. Your model also identifies 80% of cars which are actually manufactured outside of the USA. Bear in mind that these metrics are based on a relatively small testing set.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Weighted metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of looking at these ratios is to weight them across the positive and negative predictions. You can do this by creating an evaluator object and then calling the evaluate() method. This method accepts an argument which specifies the required metric. It's possible to request the weighted precision and recall as well as the overall accuracy. It's also possible to get the F1 metric, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which is generally more robust than the accuracy. All of these metrics have assumed a threshold of one half. What happens if you vary that threshold?\n",
    "\n",
    "14. ROC and AUC\n",
    "\n",
    "A threshold is used to decide whether the number returned by the Logistic Regression model translates into either the positive or the negative class. By default that threshold is set at a half. However, this is not the only choice. Choosing a larger or smaller value for the threshold will affect the performance of the model. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate versus the false positive rate as the threshold increases from zero (top right) to one (bottom left). The AUC summarizes the ROC curve in a single number. It's literally the area under the ROC curve. AUC indicates how well a model performs across all values of the threshold. An ideal model, that performs perfectly regardless of the threshold, would have AUC of 1. In an exercise we'll see how to use another evaluator to calculate the AUC.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Let's do Logistic Regression!\n",
    "\n",
    "You now know how to build a Logistic Regression model and assess the performance of that model using various metrics. Let's give this a try!"

    "## Turning Text into Tables\n",
    "1. Turning Text into Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "It's said that 80% of Machine Learning is data preparation. As we'll see in this lesson, this is particularly true for text data. Before you can use Machine Learning algorithms you need to take unstructured text data and create structure, ultimately transforming the data into a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One record per document\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a collection of documents. These documents might be anything from a short snippet of text, like an SMS or email, to a lengthy report or book. Each document will become a record in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. One document, many columns\n",
    "\n",
    "The text in each document will be mapped to columns in the table. First the text is split into words or tokens. You then remove short or common words that do not convey too much information. The table will then indicate the number of times that each of the remaining words occurred in the text. This table is also known as a \"term-document matrix\". There are some nuances to the process, but that's the central idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A selection of children's books\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that your documents are the names of children's books. The raw data might look like this. Your job will be to transform these data into a table with one row per document and a column for each of the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Removing punctuation\n",
    "\n",
    "You're interested in words, not punctuation. You'll use regular expressions (or REGEX), a mini-language for pattern matching, to remove the punctuation symbols. Regular expressions is another big topic and outside of the scope of this course, but basically you are giving a list of symbols or text pattern to match. The hyphen is escaped by the backslashes because it has another meaning in the context of regular expressions. By escaping it you tell Spark to interpret the hyphen literally. You need to specify a column name, books.text, a pattern to be matched (stored in the variable REGEX), and the replacement text, which is simply a space. You now have some double spaces but you can use REGEX to clean those up too.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Text to tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "Next you split the text into words or tokens. You create a tokenizer object, giving it the name of the input column containing the text and the output column which will contain the tokens. The tokenizer is then applied to the text using the transform() method. In the results you see a new column in which each document has been transformed into a list of words. As a side effect the words have all been reduced to lower case.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What are stop words?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some words occur frequently in all of the documents. These common or \"stop\" words convey very little information, so you will also remove them using an instance of the StopWordsRemover class. This contains a list of stop words which can be customized if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Removing stop words\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you didn't give the input and output column names earlier, you specify them now and then apply the transform method. You could also have given these names when you created the remover.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Feature hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "Your documents might contain a large variety of words, so in principle our table could end up with an enormous number of columns, many of which would be only sparsely populated. It would also be handy to convert the words into numbers. Enter the hashing trick, which in simple terms converts words into numbers. You create an instance of the HashingTF class, providing the names of the input and output columns. You also give the number of features, which is effectively the largest number that will be produced by the hashing trick. This needs to be sufficiently big to capture the diversity in the words. The output in the hash column is presented in sparse format, which we will talk about more later on. For the moment though it's enough to note that there are two lists. The first list contains the hashed values and the second list indicates how many times each of those values occurs. For example, in the first document the word \"long\" has a hash of 8 and occurs twice. Similarly, the word \"five\" has a hash of 6 and occurs once in each of the last two documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Dealing with common words\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step is to account for some words occurring frequently across many documents. If a word appears in many documents then it's probably going to be less useful for building a classifier. We want to weight the number of counts for a word in a particular document against how frequently that word occurs across all documents. To do this you reduce the effective count for more common words, giving what is known as the \"inverse document frequency\". Inverse document frequency is generated by the IDF class, which is first fit to the hashed data and then used to generate weighted counts. The word \"five\", for example, occurs in multiple documents, so its effective frequency is reduced. Conversely, the word \"long\" only occurs in one document, so its effective frequency is increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Text ready for Machine Learning!\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse document frequencies are precisely what we need for building a Machine Learning model. Let's do that with the SMS data."

    "1. One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last chapter you saw how to use categorical variables in a model by simply converting them to indexed numerical values. In general this is not sufficient for a regression model. Let's see why.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The problem with indexed values\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cars data the type column is categorical, with six levels: 'Midsize', 'Small', 'Compact', 'Sporty', 'Large' and 'Van'. Here you can see the number of times that each of those levels occurrs in the data. You used a string indexer to assign a numerical index to each level. However, there's a problem with the index: the numbers don't have any objective meaning. The index for 'Sporty' is 3. Does it make sense to do arithmetic on that index? No. For example, it wouldn't be meaningful to add the index for 'Sporty' to the index for 'Compact'. Nor would it be valid to compare those indexes and say that 'Sporty' is larger or smaller than 'Compact'. However, a regression model works by doing precisely this: arithmetic on predictor variables. You need to convert the index values into a format in which you can perform meaningful mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dummy variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to create a column for each of the levels. Effectively you then place a check in the column corresponding to the value in each row. So, for example, a record with a type of 'Sporty' would have a check in the 'Sporty' column. These new columns are known as 'dummy variables'.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dummy variables: binary encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "However, rather than having checks in the dummy variable columns it makes more sense to use binary values, where a one indicates the presence of the corresponding level. It might occur to you that the volume of data has exploded. You've gone from a single column of categorical values to six binary encoded dummy variables. If there were more levels then you'd have even more columns. This could get out of hand. However, the majority of the cells in the new columns contain zeros. The non-zero values, which actually encode the information, are relatively infrequent. This effect becomes even more pronounced if there are more levels. You can exploit this by converting the data into a sparse format.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Dummy variables: sparse representation\n",
    "02:37 - 02:49\n",
    "Rather than recording the individual values, the sparse representation simply records the column numbers and value for the non-zero values.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Dummy variables: redundant column\n",
    "\n",
    "You can take this one step further. Since the categorical levels are mutually exclusive you can drop one of the columns. If type is not 'Midsize', 'Small', 'Compact', 'Sporty' or 'Large' then it must be 'Van'. The process of creating dummy variables is called 'One-Hot Encoding' because only one of the columns created is ever active or 'hot'. Let's see how this is done in Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. One-hot encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might expect, there's a class for doing one-hot encoding. Import the OneHotEncoder class from the feature sub-module. When instantiating the class you need to specify the names of the input and output columns. For car type the input column is the index we defined earlier. Choose 'type_dummy' as the output column name. Note that these arguments are given as lists, so it's possible to specify multiple columns if necessary. Next fit the encoder to the data. Check how many category levels have been identified: six as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. One-hot encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the encoder is set up it can be applied to the data by calling the transform() method. Let's take a look at the results. There's now a type_dummy column which captures the dummy variables. As mentioned earlier, the final level is treated differently. No column is assigned to type Van because if a vehicle isn't one of the other types then it must be a Van. To have a separate dummy variable for Van would be redundant. The sparse format used to represent dummy variables looks a little complicated. Let's take a moment to dig into dense versus sparse formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Dense versus sparse\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that you want to store a vector which consists mostly of zeros. You could store it as a dense vector, in which each of the elements of the vector is stored explicitly. This is wasteful though because most of those elements are zeros. A sparse representation is a much better alternative. To create a sparse vector you need to specify the size of the vector (in this case, eight), the positions which are non-zero (in this case, positions zero and five, noting that we start counting at zero) and the values for each of those positions, one and seven. Sparse representation is essential for effective one-hot encoding on large data sets.\n",
