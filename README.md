# Machine_Learning_with_PySpark_DataCamp
Machine Learning with PySpark course on DataCamp [here](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/machine-learning-with-pyspark)

Course Description
Spark is a powerful, general-purpose tool for working with Big Data. Spark transparently handles the distribution of computing tasks across a cluster. This means that operations are fast, but it also allows you to focus on the analysis rather than worry about technical details. In this course, you'll learn how to get data into Spark and then delve into the three fundamental Spark Machine Learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression/Classifiers, and creating pipelines. Along the way, you'll analyze a large dataset of flight delays and spam text messages. With this background, you'll be ready to harness the power of Spark and apply it to your Machine Learning projects!
